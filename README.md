pyramid-mongo-blog
==================

Source code for my pyramid/mongodb/bootstrap

** THIS IS A VERY RAW PROJECT **

This site is a basic blog engine using pyramid, mongodb and pyramid bootstrap.  It has an admin page and basic authentication.  It is also not very generic yet, with references to 'brettsblog' all over.  The admin page works for creating and editing entries, but the pages portion is still in process.  I will update this as I can.
